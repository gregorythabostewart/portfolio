              Users struggle when navigating to career consulting websites with understanding how the services offered can meet their specific professional needs. Progreso Consulting Services seeks to develop a responsive website that supports users in matching their specific needs with the services they provide.

            <p class="paragraph-4"> 
              Through a survey, competitive analysis, secondary research and user interviews, I was able to develop a responsive website that created a positive experience for users as they learned about Progreso Consulting Services and booked consultations.

              <span class="boldText">
                As I learned more about what users wanted to experience on a career consulting website, I balanced their needs with the financial and time constraints of Progreso Consulting Services and ultimately prioritized building a website that the founder could use to launch their company.                 </span>

                In the beginning stages, I met with the stakeholder in order to establish the problem space and the scope for the project.  The stakeholder outlined their need for a website that would allow users to book appointments for their admissions and career consulting business they were launching in 2024.  I outlined the design process I would take and the deliverables they would receive at the conclusion of each step of the process.              </p>

There is a range in how privately owned career service companies can meet the needs of clients in terms of using a coaching/advising model versus a pay per service model.

                I created a survey to understand what kind of experiences users were having admissions counseling/career services and their websites.  However due to time and access constraints, my stakeholder and I were not able to solicit current high schools students and/or their parents for the survey. Furthermore, while it wasn’t a surprise that many had not used these kind of services, it did present an obstacle for my research plan. I initially hypothesized that users would have experience researching the websites for these kind of services.

It also surprised me even users whose needs were not met by more traditional guidance counselors, etc. were simply not seeking out these services for whatever reason and were relying on themselves or chance to find support with navigating these processes.

              For the design of the dashboard home, I took a lot of inspiration from the designs I reviewed during the competitive analysis.  I initially sketched a secondary navigation and breadcrumbs, but went without these in my mid-fidelity wireframes since they were redundant to the primary navigation that already existed within the portal where this dashboard would exist. In the mid-fidelity designs, I added filter drop downs so that this page could be customized to the user’s needs along with labels and icons to more clearly spell out how users could manage each individual card holding a data visualization. I also added pagination at the bottom to also consider how many data visualizations users would see at once versus how much they would have to click next to view more.

Thus, I implemented tabs for users to filter the types of services between applying, exploring and all. Initially I was using a large pills to represent the clickable tabs on the services screens.  These pills were not super responsive when translated to the mobile viewport.  In researching best practices for tab design, I stumbled upon an article from Medium that inspired my redesign of the tabs.

              For the booking flow, I needed to allow users to select multiple services they were interested in, select a date/time, input personal details and receive a confirmation of the appointment. I used Calendly as a reference for the date and time screen.  I also needed to incorporate a progress bar that allowed users to understand where they were at every step of the process and buttons that would allow them to go back and move forward. . Initially I was using a large pill with arrows to convey progress to the user during book.  But this did not translate well to a mobile viewport.  I did some research and was inspired by progress bars on Dribbble.  It worked better as a responsive component for my designs.

                Using their preferences, I created and presented 4 style samples of a potential homepage. The style the stakeholder moved forward with had more of an airy, calming and welcoming feel and incorporated blue primary buttons and circles.

                For the button design, I made sure there was enough padding around the text. It was important to make sure the text size was large enough for readability and that the text was bold and all caps. The stakeholder liked the bright blue for the CTA to add a sense of calm to the site.

              <p class="paragraph-4">
                I drafted a usability test plan and collaborated with the stakeholder on finding subjects to test.  The main considerations for testing was whether users were able to complete the booking flow and understand the purpose of the site from the landing. Before finalizing the plan, I iterated on the questions to make sure they would actually generate usable feedback.  We ended up selected 3/5 of the folks from user interviews with two people chosen by the stakeholder.  The pools represented a variety of career stages, the target age group and a variety of professions.

              <p class="paragraph-4">
                Testing found no errors with the website in terms of flow all users were successfully able to explore the site and book consultations. Users did however have a lot of rich feedback about how to iterate and improve on the website's design.

              <br><br>
              <p class="paragraph-4">
I ranked the feedback in terms of how critical it was in terms of potentially impacting the user's journey. I found that from the feedback the most two critical things to address were the communication of the site's purpose via the landing page and the ability to request a free consultation over the phone.
                            </p>

              <p class="paragraph-4">
                I presented all the findings to the stakeholder and we collaborated on the effort-value matrix. The quick wins we decided on were based on time and effort constraints for the stakeholder. Thus the two revisions I recommended ended up as big bets, requiring a bit more time/effort on the stakeholders behalf.

              <p class="paragraph-4" style="margin-bottom:0px;">
                During the Design stage, I designed and tested the website making important considerations about the following elements as I increased the fidelity of my designs:

              </p>
              <ul class="paragraph-4" style="padding:0px;margin:0px;">
                <li>
I created a storyboard in order to understand how the responsive website would address the needs of users seeking career consulting services                 
                </li>
                <li>
                  I created a feature roadmap that prioritized screens for services, testimonials, booking, details about the company/founder and contacting the company                
                </li>
                <li>
                  I designed a site map with a landing page, booking page, services page and about us page                                </li>
                <li>
                  I designed user flows that followed a user as they visited the site to learn about the services and eventually booked a consultation
                                                </li>
                <li>
                  I designed each of these key screens incorporating inspiration to make sure all components on the site were responsive as I increased the fidelity of my designs 
                                                </li>
                <li>
                  I collaborated with the stakeholder to develop a style guide that represented the company’s brand and develop a library of harmonious components that also fit the brand
                                                </li>
                <li>
                  I created and tested a prototype to see what users thought the purpose and intended audience of the company was from the landing page and how successful they were at learning more about the company’s services and eventually booking a consultation with the company
                                                </li>
                <li>
                  Finally, there was a lot of feedback so I prioritized feedback around clarifying the company’s services and their outcomes for potential users as well as making sure the UI was inclusive and accessible for all types of users
                                                </li>

              <p class="paragraph-25">
                The next steps in this project would involve addressing the recommendations I made. The landing page could be reimagined to more clearly communicate the site's purpose.  Below, I included a reimagining of what the landing page could look like. 
                                          </p>

                Additionally, there also could be a shift to a free consultation before users commit to a paid service which also might impact the overall flow. There are features that could potentially be incorporated on the site as well in terms of a payment section and an intake section both of which are currently absent from the site.

          <br>
          <p class="paragraph-28">While this project did not take a bunch of twists and turns, it was a crash course in collaborating with a stakeholder. I was challenged to be organized and communicate clearly in order for the best design decisions to be made.  The usability tests provided really rich feedback but the stakeholder was really committed to achieving their goals of having a site that was minimally usable and attractive.  This demonstrated to me how the stakeholder's desires can be a roadblock to implement changes that users truly desire.  While I think I knew this as a customer/user of products, it was fascinating to witness it unfold from the business/design perspective.</p>
