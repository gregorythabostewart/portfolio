          <p class="paragraph-6">
            The process of finding and booking appointments with healthcare providers can present particular challenges for users seeking an easy, convenient and simple process that centers the patient instead of the provider. Users can become overwhelmed by the multitude of substeps needed to navigate each of these processes respectively. This can be especially frustrating for users who are sick and/or in need of medical attention sooner rather than later.                      </p>

            <h4 class="heading-8">The Problem</h4>
            <p class="paragraph-4"> 
              Users can particularly feel disconnected from their doctors when they leave appointments and navigating messy and exhausting websites booking appointments and/or figure out how to contact their provider can influence them to avoid seeing their providers altogether.

            <h4 class="heading-10">The Solution</h4>
            <p class="paragraph-4"> 
              Through a survey, competitive analysis, secondary research and user interviews, I uncovered a surprising insight about users who seek to connect with medical providers on booking websites.  While I hypothesized that solving usability issues with regards to the flow of booking appointments would increase booking, I actually found the issue connectedness to providers to be a pervasive issue in a user’s experience of healthcare.   

              <br><br>
              <span class="boldText">
                Thus I created Clinicly, a responsive website, aimed at allowing users to not only schedule appointments, but also connect users with providers and serve as a mode of communication as well between users and providers.                </span>

                At the beginning of this project, I knew I wanted to focus on a problem related to healthcare, but I was not sure whether I wanted to focus on issues related to preventative care or issues related to users visiting healthcare professionals. I used the survey to learn more about the kinds of challenges users were facing with respect to these aspects of healthcare, ultimately so I could zoom in on a particular aspect.  There was definitely overlap in the kinds of issues users faced with regard to both aspects but I found more of a range of issues under the topic of visiting healthcare professionals.  Not only were users indicating issues with navigating booking sites, but they were also having issues finding providers, completing intake and communicating with providers among other things.

                  Users actually indicated by far more provider-facing issues and missing features rather than usability issues with sites used to book appointments, when asked to indicate issues they had experienced.

In order to learn more about the context and scope of medical scheduling, I conducted a quick Google search.  I learned that medical scheduling websites date back to the early 2000s and sought to connect users with information that would help them make informed decisions about medical providers. The predecessor of these services were a multitude of privately healthcare software systems, like Epic Systems (which hosts MyChart) that focused more on issues related to the provider-side of healthcare (e.g. patient registration, bill systems for insurers, etc.)

                I constructed a interview protocol that would allow me to learn more not just about their issues with booking medical appointment, but their motivations and goals as well.  I picked 5 potential users to interview from those who indicated they were interested in participating on the survey. The users consisted of men and women, of various racial and ethnic backgrounds between the ages of 26 and 61 enabling me to have a wide range of perspectives. I recorded each interview on Zoom and took notes.

            <p class="paragraph-4">
              Initially, I hypothesized that users would experience issues related to scheduling, limited functionality/poorly formatted platforms, inaccurate provider details, lack of ability to find providers based on specific needs.  Taking into consideration that I couldn’t solve for some of the issues that were related to providers, I decided to explore ways to help users with longstanding relationships with healthcare providers to feel more connected to their providers because they feel disconnected once they leave the provider and feel like they to take their health into their own hands.  
                          <br><br><span class="boldText">
                            This prompted me to focus on how my responsive site could serve as a communication platform and allow users to communicate with providers directly as a way to positively affect the connectedness users feel with their providers. The problem of how we might increase the communication and transference of information between patients and providers tackled this.

              While coming up with ideas of potential features using the creative constraints and the analogous inspiration strategies, I consulted my competitive analysis.  The following features that were present in all the websites I examined were prioritized as must-haves:

              The patient portal homepage was a key screen that I sketched and translated into mid fidelity and then high fidelity wire frames. With the personas in mind, I considered the context that users would typically be accessing this website either on their phone or computers so I prioritized those screens.  For the patient portal in particular, I wanted this screen to be very learnable and memorable allowing users both to understand the overall information hierarchy easily and be able to do this without fail however frequently they logged.   So I made the decision to focus on buttons for the major actions that users needed to complete in the context that they needed make decision or take action regarding their health.  I eventually these buttons evolved into cards that contained helper text and icons.  I thought that it would be simple to adjust these cards into the desktop screen since I was using a mobile-first approach.

But I also wanted to make sure users weren’t overwhelmed by this process and thus, I mimicked MyChart’s organization of this flow that gave each step a unique screen.  I eventually incorporated a go back button for each screen as visualized below in order to give the user more control over their actions and allow them to recover from an potential errors.  I also incorporated clearer helper text to guide user’s actions.  mimicked MyChart’s flow for messaging a provider, also allowing users to indicate the type of message and specific provider they would like to contact.

              <p class="paragraph-4">
                I thought it was important to create a brand that put users at ease who might be sick and/or in distress when they are navigating the website.  Thus I was drawn to a really light blue with a orange contrast color for highlights.  I presented three different logos I had sketched to other designers and received feedback that one logo in particular looked seemed to fit the overall vibe in my style tile.  The following words were used:

              </p>
              <div class="center-images">
                <a data-fancybox="images21" href="../../assets/Clinicly16.png"><img

              </div>
              <br>              <br>

  <p class="paragraph-4">
    This was the exact vibe I was aiming for and so I decided to move forward.  I continued to experiment with the thickness of the lines to make sure logo was actually readable as it scaled to different sizes.   For consistency, I incorporated components that were equally as simple and clean typically using black against a light background for a level contrast and accessibility.  I was able to check for contrast using the Coloors contrast checker online.

              <p class="paragraph-4">
                For the button design, I made sure there was enough padding around the text. It was important to make sure the text size was large enough for readability and that the text was bold and all caps.  I chose the blue for the button to create a sense of calm on the different screens. I also opted for a rectangular shape with a slight curve on on the corners for the primary button. It was important to prove enough padding around the buttons label.  I put the label in the body font type and size, but all caps to make it stand out and still be readable. I used similar specs for all buttons and adjusted them for the mobile version as well in order to create overall consistency and similarity throughout the component design.

Once I had finished creating a prototype for the sending a message flow, I began usability testing.  I used the same 5 users who I had conducted user interviews with for the usability testing. 
<br><br>
<span class="boldText">The goal was to determine if the flow was intuitive to the user given the task of messaging a provider. </span>
<br><br>
Users testing the website needed to log in, sending a new message to their provider and view their sent message.  As a designer, I was concerned with how intuitive and simple the flow was and whether it was what users expected to experience.  My quantitative success metrics were the task completion rate and the user rating of difficulty (1 to 5, with 5 being the most challenging).  My qualitative success metrics were user’s feedback on their experience with the website.

                I reworked the portal page view to emphasize the hamburger menu which holds all user actions rather than the cards on the portal page.  The approach of centralizing the hamburger menu allows for progressive disclosure, rather than overwhelming users with a number of various actions.  I also incorporated a dashboard and provided actions tied to each provider for the user.

                <li>
                  I created a feature roadmap that prioritized patient-facing features (portal, directory and messaging) while deprioritizing other features                 </li>
                <li>
                  I conducted a card sort to help me make important decisions about the content hierarchy on the site such as allowing users multiple routes to the same destination

                Based on the feedback, I could iterate next on the log in screen and the individual message page.  The feedback I received for these screens included providing an alternative way for user to log in so they don't have to remember password (e.g. one time code), adding labels for the log in screen, and adding message status for sent messages. The one time code reduces potential user errors when typing in their email and password while the message view screen provides user feedback about their action.  I’ve included screens for what these iterations could look like.

          <p class="paragraph-28">This project showed me the power of user research to drive your definition of the problem you are trying to solve for.  It was important for me to reflect on my initial hypothesis and be able to move in whatever direction the research indicated.  This required me to be nimble, but I was also able to learn so much about users’ experience of healthcare today.  This project definitely inspired me to think big about designing solutions that transform the healthcare industry in ways that positively impact patients.
            A major limitation for the project was that I only had access to patient users. That said, I would need to conduct more research in order to define the problems and solutions that are provider-facing. </p>
