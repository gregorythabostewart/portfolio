          <p class="paragraph-6">
            Rhymes with Reason was launched in 2017 by Austin Martin to help students learn important English words by showcasing their existence in widely-known music lyrics.  They partner with different sponsors to provide the product to students nationwide via their computer-based platform.          </p>

            <p class="paragraph-4"> 
              The team at Rhymes with Reason has myriad data about student progress and experiences and teacher experiences and manually puts this data into charts in order to track trends about their product.  The team ultimately was looking for a solution that would allow them to generate multivariable and longitudinal data visualizations on compiled data.             </p>

            <h4 class="heading-10">The Solution</h4>
            <p class="paragraph-4"> 
              By conducting a literature review, observational study, and competitive analysis of existing solutions, I was able to develop a company-facing analytics dashboard that allows the Rhymes with Reason team to organize and manipulate data about their product.

              <span class="boldText">
                After understanding the workflows involved in the process of compiling and manipulating data, I had to prioritize creating an informational architecture that made sense to the context of the jobs being done by the Rhymes with Reason team.              </span>

              <p class="paragraph-9"> 
                I approached the founder whom I attended undergrad with and offered to work with them to gain experience as a UX designer.  After initially presenting 4 potential projects I could work on, the founder narrowed it to one high priority problem.  The founder was interested in building a data visualizer dashboard that would allow them to use data drive the growth of their company.  During kickoff, I worked with the founder to develop a project brief outlining the scope of my work, a timeline and any constraints we needed to consider.  The main constraint was time.

              <p class="paragraph-9"> 
                In terms of conducting research for this project, I needed to understand the main workflows that were occuring amongst the Rhymes with Reason team. To do, this I requested the key documents involved in data compilation and analysis.  I examined their approach to coming up with progress indicators. I looked at data compiled for a single customer. I also looked at their tools for collecting data which included Google Forms surveys and an internal screen of their product. I mainly had questions about where data lived and what their business model was.              </p>

              <p class="paragraph-9"> 
                The next step for my research was to dip a bit deeper into the workflows involved in data compilation by doing an observational study with key members of the team.  I conducted the study virtually and took notes as the founder, the person in charge of evaluation/metrics, and the person in charge of customer success walked me through the task of compiling data for a single customer.

                  Here I was able to understand some of the business goals for the project: 1) to be able to define and replicate best practices for their product across users, and 2) to be able to leverage data about their product during renewal meetings with customers.                </span>

            <p class="paragraph-17">
              Later down the line, the following features were included in the design because they were instrumental to the information architecture.  I also was able to explain to the founder how creating a report builder for this solution is a secondary feature that could be deprioritized until the primary solution was developed.

I incorporated the partnership profiles sections initially simply so that the visualization could be linked to the corresponding customers.  My thinking was that these tasks would occur largely in isolation of the customer page.

            <h4 id="homePageDesign">Dashboard Home Design</h4>
            <p class="paragraph-17">
              For the design of the dashboard home, I took a lot of inspiration from the designs I reviewed during the competitive analysis.  I initially sketched a secondary navigation and breadcrumbs, but went without these in my mid-fidelity wireframes since they were redundant to the primary navigation that already existed within the portal where this dashboard would exist. In the mid-fidelity designs, I added filter drop downs so that this page could be customized to the user’s needs along with labels and icons to more clearly spell out how users could manage each individual card holding a data visualization. I also added pagination at the bottom to also consider how many data visualizations users would see at once versus how much they would have to click next to view more.
                        </p>
            <br><br>
            <div class="center-images image-12" data-w-id="c182771a-a21e-34f4-e46b-e76c93ddb5a2">

              </a>
            </div>
            <p class="paragraph-17">
              Although this wasn’t a key screen I sketched, a major component of designing the prototype was designing the flow users would take to add a new data visualization.  For this, I studied the way this process occurs on Google Sheets where users input data into the cells, highlight the cells and add a chart. From there users, edit the chart’s settings using a chart editor.  I attempted to translate this into a flow with screens with modal that broke up the process into each of the four following steps: 1) import data from file, 2) select data points, 3) indicate inputs and outputs and 4) link and publish charts.

            <p class="paragraph-20">
              I also incorporated a screen that would allow users to manage the files with the data.  At this point, I thought that it made sense for these to exist near the screen on which users were creating data visualizations so I created a tab for each of these tasks.  As I moved on to the mid-fidelity screen, I again created filters and pagination for users to be able to view relevant files when needed. I also clarified the information that users would need to see per file and the actions users could take on individual files.  My competitive research did not really showcase screens that contained lists of files or what it would look like to upload files so I took to Dribbble for inspiration on how what to include and how to design the flow.

              For the partner profile page, I moved the partner details to the left in the mid-fidelity design.  I Also clarified the different screens users could navigate to as notes, todo list, calendar and activity record, allowing users to publish updates like Facebook.  I also incorporated a feed for users to view these updates chronologically and filters to be able to narrow them down when needed as well.  My competitive research did not really examine SaaS companies like Github and Salesforce so I researched these for inspiration.  I incorporated patterns like the user photo on the left, the tabs to organize the different feeds.

                For the design of the components, I applied best practices. I applied the styles from Rhymes with Reason’s branding guide later on after doing testing on the mid-fidelity wireframes.  There weren’t a ton of rules in the branding guide so I iterated to make sure that the components were accessible while also maintaining the style of the company.

              <p class="paragraph-4">
                I drafted a usability test plan and collaborated with the stakeholder to conducting testing with the key admin team members  The subjects included the founder, the person in charge of evaluation and metrics, the operations manager, person in charge of customer success and one of the software engineers. Before finalizing the plan, I iterated on the questions to make sure they would actually generate usable feedback.  The major priorities for testing were testing the four flows of uploading files, generating data visuals, filtering data visuals and navigating to a partners profile and understand users’ preference for different views of the files and different organizations of the site’s content.

              <p class="paragraph-4">
                Testing found no errors with the website in terms of flow all users were successfully able to complete the four tasks. Users did however have a lot of rich feedback about the information architecture, the individual task flows, preferences of specific views, the specific jobs to be done and additional features they would like to see.

              <p class="paragraph-4">
                I focused the majority of my revisions on the high priority issue of revising information architecture.  I moved the partner profiles list to the dashboard so that the actions of uploading files and adding data visualizations would happen on a partner’s page.  This ended up simplifying some steps of the task flows since users no longer needed to link data visualizations or files to partners.  I also added a section to this screen for aggregate analytics across partners as a tab.

              </div>
              <br><br>
              <p class="paragraph-4">
                This also meant that the partner profiles needed revisions as well.  I changed the tabs to hold the screens for activities, analytics and documents.  I also removed the text field and instead left the button which would trigger the text field when pressed.  This way, I left more of the screen for the activities and created coherence between the activity screen, the analytics screen and the documents screen.

              <p class="paragraph-4" style="margin-bottom:0px;">
                During the Design stage, I designed and tested the website making important considerations about the following elements as I increased the fidelity of my designs:
              
              </p>
              <ul class="paragraph-4" style="padding:0px;margin:0px;">
                <li>
                  I created a storyboard in order to put the persona in the context of the solution I was designing
                
                </li>
                <li>
                  I created a feature roadmap that prioritized features that accomplished the most important jobs to be done: uploading files, creating data visualizations, filtering data visualization and navigating to partner profiles
                
                </li>
                <li>
                  I designed a site map encompassing sections for the analytics, documents and partner profiles 
                                </li>
                <li>
                  I designed user flows focused primarily on uploading data files, adding/filtering data visualizations, and navigating to a partner profile
                                </li>
                <li>
                  I designed a dashboard screen and partner profile screen focusing on clarifying the specific actions needed to be able to take on each screen as I increased fidelity
                                </li>
                <li>
                  I created component using best practices 
                                </li>
                <li>
                  I tested a prototype to understand whether users could accomplish the 4 tasks that encompassed the jobs to be done and understand their preferences for the flows, and overall design/IA
                                </li>
                <li>
                  Post-testing, I revised the information architecture to make the feature partner profile first, allowing users to complete the other actions from within these profiles

            <p class="paragraph-24">
              Since I conducted testing on the mid-fidelity wireframes, I applied the branding after the testing was complete.  The final design incorporated the changes to the information architecture as well the corresponding changes to the task flows for uploading files, adding data visualizations and filtering data visualizations.  Upon delivery, I sent the stakeholder an annotated UI library, high fidelity wireframes, final clickable prototype and a recording of the prototype.

                The next steps in this project would involve doing more research into which additional features would provide the most value to the Rhymes with Reason team.  The features I cited in the feature roadmap for later iterations was the report builder since the stakeholder wanted to be able to generate customized reports based on the data visualizations.  During testing users also indicated some of the features they would like to see:

          <br>
          <p class="paragraph-28">In this project, I was able to build upon my previous experience working with a stakeholder and really be more of the driver of decision-making as I collaborated with the new stakeholder.  There were key moments where I had to pushback against the stakeholder to prioritize building a minimum viable product. Namely, I had to pushback against incorporating the report builder without first doing testing on the dashboard without it.  It turned out that the entire information architecture needed to be revamped so I’m glad I pushed for that decision.  Similarly, this example of critical testing feedback demonstrated just how important testing is and how it can be important to test as soon as soon as possible.  Even though I was able to define the specific problem and develop a solution, the way the solution was designed needed to be informed a bit more by the user’s needs.</p>
