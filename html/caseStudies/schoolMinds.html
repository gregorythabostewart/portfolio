          <h4 class="heading-10">Background</h4>
          <p class="paragraph-6">Teaching encompasses a lot of processes that often must occur both simultaneously and in short periods of time: developing challenging and engaging material, building relationships with colleagues and students, and constantly refining their instructional practice.   As a former teacher, I am interested in the ways that teachers use different tools to help carry out these processes.</p>
          <br>
          <div id="problem" class="subgroup">
            <h4 class="heading-8">The Problem</h4>
            <p class="paragraph-4"> 
              Developing new curricular materials from scratch can take a lot of time.  Educators often expedite this process by searching for and adapting the materials of other educators. The particular problem that SchoolMinds seeks to solve is how to allow teachers to access materials created by other educators, manage these materials and be able to to understand how these material can be adapted to their instructional needs.

          <div id="solution" class="subgroup">
            <h4 class="heading-10">The Solution</h4>
            <p class="paragraph-4"> 
              Through a survey, competitive analysis, a prioritization exercise and user interviews, I was able to develop an end to end that enabled teachers to share curricular materials with other educators, find materials created by other educators and manage these all from the palm of their hand. 
              <br><br>
              <span class="boldText">As I learned more about the solutions that teachers were already engaging with, I was able marry features from different products into a single product that met teachers exactly where they are at.</span>

              <p class="paragraph-9"> Initially, I set out to discover a particular area of teaching that teachers were engaging with tools in order to meet their needs.  In order to do this, I developed a survey tool that asks teachers to indicate which areas of teaching were most significant to them and how they were utilizing different tools to help them meet the challenges they were facing in these areas. I found the most responses in the following for areas related to curriculum and instruction:</p>
              <ol class="paragraph-9" style="padding:0px;">
                <li>Differentiating curriculum</li>

              <h4 class="heading-11">User Interviews</h4>
              <p class="paragraph-9">In order to also understand the specific experiences that teachers were having with respect to these four problem areas, I also conducted user interviews with 5 current educators representing a diversity of contexts: </p>
              <ul class="paragraph-9" style="padding:0px; margin:0px;">
                <li>high school and elementary school </li>

                <li>humanities and stem</li>
                <li>1.5-7.5 years of classroom experience</li>
              </ul>
              <br>
              <p class="paragraph-9">The interviews were mainly concerned with the challenges these educators were experiencing and how they were using different tools to meet these challenges.</p>

              <br>
              <div id="prioritizationExercise" class="subgroup">
                <h4>Prioritization Exercise</h4>
                <p class="paragraph-9">In order to narrow down a particular problem area, I had 5 teachers do a prioritization exercise.  I created four fictional products that addressed the four problem areas that the survey had indicated were significant to teachers.  I asked the teachers to indicate how they would allocate a finite amount of money to products that addressed each of these problems and then explain the reasoning behind their allocations. <br><br>Of the 4 potential products that users could allocate funds to, the highest (overall and average) allocations were giving to the product allowing users to share curricular tools and content with each other.  The second highest allocations were given to the product that helped users find culturally relevant sources.</p>

              <h4>Competitive Analysis</h4>
              <p class="paragraph-11">
                I found that educators were using many products that weren’t explicitly created for teachers as teaching tools. For my competitive analysis, I set out to evaluate how these tools were meeting the needs of teachers and supporting them with the processes involved in teaching.  I examined four competitors that emerged from survey and interview data: Facebook groups, Teachers Pay Teachers, Google Drive, and Twitter.

                I found 3 genres of products that were being used by educators. Each genre gave an insight into the needs of educators with respect to a tool that supported their work around curriculum.

              The problem of how might we enable teachers to access the curricular materials of other teachers and understand how these can be adapted for their needs captures the goal of bringing educational resources of other educators to teachers and demystifying how these materials can be readily implemented.

              There only seemed to be two personas when considering a product that would allow teachers to share materials with one another.  The main behavioral difference being their willingness to share materials versus need to look for materials, and this could be related to their level of teaching experience.            </p>

                  The affinity map underscored the limited resources of teachers and the need to make lessons meaningful.  But I also learned about the explicit role metacognition plays in lesson planning.                </li>

                  I also examined 2 personas that diverged in their willingness/confidence to share materials with other teachers due to their level of teaching experience (and thus willingness/confidence/capacity to share materials)                 </li>

              Initially, I conceptualized the home page to be a dashboard. I thought that it would make sense for users to take multiple actions on this page and have shortcuts to other parts of the app. After raising it in GroupCrits and taking inspiration from Pinterest, I decided to make the home page the search/explore page. This made more sense as the first page that users land on when they enter the app.   This allowed me to use the nav bar to hold the primary actions that users would be taking on the app instead of having the dashboard serve this function.

              As I increased fidelity, one major consideration I needed to make was how to construct the cards that would hold the material. I had to consider what image would be displayed and how much space the text needed.  Initially, I was taking inspiration from Pinterest in terms of card construction. In the final iteration, there is 1 card per row leaving ample space for the material title text. I also made the decision for users to select styles for image so that the images would be formatted consistently.

              For the saved material page, I had similar considerations around the organization of the cards on the screens and the tabs that would help users filter through the content.  I also initially design these cards each with drop down menus, but did away with these since the cards were clickable and there was very little space for these menus.

              Finally, I went through a lot of iteration on the bottom nav menu.  As I previously discussed the initially major decisions was around the home screen.  Once I decided to make the home screen the search page, that clarified the other actions (upload new material, view saved material, connect with users, annotate material).  The next biggest consideration to make was around symbolizing these actions through language and iconography.  I changed the home icon to search so there was clarity around the home screen’s function.  The biggest adjustment was the addition of a large plus button instead of a planning tab, also inspired by Pinterest.  I believed this would be a familiar and accessible component indicating adding new content to users and it would always be an action available.

                For the brand of this app, I explored a lot of ideas for brand names.  I was tempted to go with something simple like TeacherMade, but found many of these options already being utilized for existing products. SchoolMinds was one of the few ideas that got positive feedback during a GroupCrit as it captured the collaborative nature of the brand.  I also experimented with two color palettes after research other educational apps/platforms used by teachers.  I found that the combination of orange, purple, yellow and green/blue received positive feedback in terms of capturing the joyful, engaged and curious aspects of the brand.   Finally, I played around a lot with different ideas for the logo. The most unique idea was three stick figures whose hands were touching each other.  I found that they also created the outline of a book.  After initially being concerned that this logo wouldn’t scale, I was able to thicken the line so that it would be able scale.  I then added the brand colors and found that it captured the brand values and complimented the brand name very nicely.

                For the button design, I made sure there was enough padding around the text. It was important to make sure the text size was large enough for readability and that the text was medium. I chose the purple for the button to contrast from the yellow in the plus button. I also opted for a very curved corners.

                During the Design stage, I designed and tested an app based on allowing teachers to access and manage materials created by other teachers.

              <ul class="paragraph-4" style="padding:0px;margin:0px;">
                <li>The storyboard I created helped me contextualize the product’s purpose and the corresponding features that would meet the needs of the personas I had developed</li>
                <li>The feature roadmap helped me determine that the MVP of the app consistent of allowing users to share and access content and that other features could be deprioritized</li>
                <li>The site map helped me translate the must have features into a coherent and intuitive information hierarchy </li>
                <li>I designed a home screen that I eventually made the search page to help establish purpose when users first open the app</li>
                <li>I designed a saved material screen that users could use to help them manage the content they found during search</li>
                <li>I designed a nav bar that used familiar and accessible language and iconography to further convey to users the purpose of the app and how it could meet their needs</li>
                <li>I created a brand capturing the joyful, engaged, curious and collaborative nature of the SchoolMinds app through color choices and an original logo design</li>
                <li>I created components following best practices that also fit the brand </li>
                <li>I designed and tested prototype to get feedback on users’ experience using the app to upload material, find new material and manage material</li>
                <li>I prioritized feedback that improved the experience of the search page and the saved material page and clarified the format of materials and ability to export materials upon saving them</li>

                The next steps in this project would involve addressing some of the big bets that users brought up such as adding the ability for users to leave reviews about material they have used, thinking about how to populate the app with materials prior to its launch, exploring different viewports for users who want to work from desktop or iPad, integrating this app with other platforms teachers share material on and do more testing on testing in STEM to see if this app meets their needs.  As a next step, I would also build out the screens for the notes and teams features that I deprioritized in the feature roadmap.

          <br>
          <p class="paragraph-28">In this project I was able to select an audience and discover a problem organically through research in this project.  I was able to use the research that zoomed in on solutions that users were using that weren’t necessarily built for them, understand the ways these solutions were being used and actually design something for this audience based on the tools they had been using.  It was really refreshing to hear the ways that this app could be implemented right away during testing and it definitely shapes my identity as a UX designer.  I really want to be able to make apps like this that impact people’s lives in positive ways. </p>
